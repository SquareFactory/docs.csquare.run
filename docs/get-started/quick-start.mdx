### 1. Create a project

If you don't have any project, start by [creating a new one](../projects/create-a-project). To do so, from the home page, click
on Create a new project, and follow the steps. Once created, you will be redirected to your new project's dashboard.

Go to the `datasets` page using the sidebar menu, and [create a new dataset](../datasets/create-a-dataset).
