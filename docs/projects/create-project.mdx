**csquare** is project-based, which means that all your jobs and datasets should be reassembled under project entities. This guide will help you to create a project step-by-step.

## Quick guide

<VideoPlayer src="/videos/projects-create-project.webm" />

## Step-by-step

1. Access the project creation form
   - From the hub
     1. Go to the `Hub` page (`https://csquare.run/`).
     2. On the `Getting started` widget, click on `Create a new project`.
   - From the Quick start module
     1. Go to the `Hub` page (`https://csquare.run/`).
     2. Click on `Quick start`.
     3. Click on the `+` button in the top right corner.
   - From anywhere
     1. Click on the project dropdown in the header.
     2. Click on the `+` button in the top-right corner of the `Switch project` pop-up.
2. Fill the form:
   1. Specify the name of your new project in the `Name` field.
   2. Choose the organization your project will be included in. Consult the [dedicated documentation](../organizations/introduction) for more info about organization management.
   3. If you want to share your project with collaborators, specify their email address in the `Email address` field. You can add fields by clicking on the `+` button at the end of the form row. **Your collaborators will have reading rights by default.** It is possible to update project collaborators permissions in the `Collaborators` page. [See how](collaborators/update-permissions).
   4. Click on the `Create` button.

You can now see your project in the projects list: well done!
