title: Copy a project template

import VideoPlayer from '../../src/components/VideoPlayer';

**csquare** shares public projects that can be used as basis for your own project. Copying a project template allows
you to get the whole structure and related resources to this project, e.g., datasets and models. This guide will help
you to understand how to create a project based on a public template.

:::success Tip

Using a project template create a private copy of said project. It means that you can afterwards customise the project
and add your own resources for example. Only collaborators from the project or the organization will be able to see
these changes.

## Step-by-step

1. Go to the `hub` page (`https://csquare.run/`)
2. Click on `Use a project template` in the `Your projects` widget.
3. Click on the `+` button of the template you want to use.
4. Fill the form:
   1. Specify the name of your new project in the `Name` field.
   2. Choose the organization your project will be included in. Consult the [dedicated documentation](../organizations/introduction) for more info about organization management.
   3. If you want to share your project with collaborators, specify their email address in the `Email address` field. You can add fields by clicking on the `+` button at the end of the form row. **Your collaborators will have reading rights by default.** It is possible to update project collaborators permissions in the `Collaborators` page. [See how](collaborators/update-permissions).
