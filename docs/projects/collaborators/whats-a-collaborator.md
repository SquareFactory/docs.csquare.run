title: What's a collaborator?
---

## Definition

**Collaborators** are people you want to share your projects with. Collaborators of your project are
also [members](../../organizations/invite-a-collaborator.mdx) of the
project [organization](../../organizations/introduction.md).

## Permissions

Collaborators' access are controlled using **permissions**, that can be managed via the `Collaborators` page. There are
3 levels of permissions, that are summarized in the following table:

| Permission | Possible actions                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Read       | <ul><li>Navigate through the whole project: datasets and models</li> <li>See the project's collaborators</li></ul> |
| Write      | <ul><li>Read access</li><li>Create, delete, and modify projects, datasets and models</li></ul>                     |
| Admin      | <ul><li>Read + write access</li><li>Manage collaborators permissions</li></ul>                                     |
