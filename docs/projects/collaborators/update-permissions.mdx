## Step-by-step
### As an admin

1. [Select a project](../select-a-project).
2. Go to the `Collaborators` page.
3. Click on the permissions you want your collaborator to have on the dedicated line.

That's it! Well done.

### As a non-admin user

**Only project admins can update their collaborators permissions.** Contact a project admin to handle permission management.
