A project can be shared with `Collaborators`. Collaborators' access are controlled using permissions (`read`, `write`, `admin`), that can be managed via the `Collaborators` page.

### As an admin

1. [Select a project](select-a-project.md).
2. Go to the `Collaborators` page.
3. Click on the right you want your collaborator to have on the dedicated line.

#### That's it! Well done.

### As a non-admin user

**Only project admins can update their collaborators permissions.** Contact a project admin to handle right changes.
