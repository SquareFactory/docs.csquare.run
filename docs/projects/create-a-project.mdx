## Step-by-step

1. #### Access the project creation form
    - ##### From the hub
        1. Go to the `hub` page (`https://csquare.run/`).
        2. On the `Getting started` widget, click on `Create a new project`.
    - ##### From anywhere
        1. Click on the project dropdown in the header.
        2. Click on the `+` button in the top-right corner of the `Switch project` pop-up.
2. #### Fill the form:
    1. Specify the name of your new project in the `Name` field.
    2. Choose the organization your project will be included in. Consult the [`Organizations` documentation](../organizations/introduction) for more info about organization management.
    3. If you want to share your project with collaborators, specify their email address in the `Email address` field. You can add fields by clicking on the `+` button at the end of the form row. **Your collaborators will have reading rights by default.** It is possible to update project collaborators permissions in the `Collaborators` page. [See how](collaborators/update-permissions).
    4. Click on the `Create` button.
3. #### You can now see your project in the projects list: well done!
