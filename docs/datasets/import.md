title: Import an existing dataset
---

You can use the same dataset across multiple projects.
For example, let's say that you have created the `pandas` dataset into the `animals` project and you now want to use the `pandas` dataset into the `jungle` project.

To do so, you have to **Import** the `pandas` dataset into the `jungle` project.

1. Login to csquare and select the target project (in our case, this is the `jungle` project);
2. Open the sidebar and go to the `Datasets` page;
3. Click on the `Import` button;
4.
