You can use the same dataset across multiple projects.

**For example:** You created the `pandas` dataset into the `animals` project, and you now want to use the `pandas` dataset into the `jungle` project.
To do so, you have to **Import** the `pandas` dataset into the `jungle` project.

3. Click on the `Import` button;
4. Chose the dataset you want to import to your current project.
