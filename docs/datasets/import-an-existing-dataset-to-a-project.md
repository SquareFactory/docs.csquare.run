title: Import an existing dataset to a project
---

You can use the same dataset across multiple projects.

**For example:** You created the `pandas` dataset into the `animals` project, and you now want to use the `pandas` dataset into the `jungle` project.
To do so, you have to **Import** the `pandas` dataset into the `jungle` project.

1. [Select the project](docs/projects/select-a-project.md) you want to import the dataset into.
2. Open the sidebar and go to the `Datasets` page;
3. Click on the `Import` button;
4. Chose the dataset you want to import to your current project.
5. Click on the `Confirm` button.

You can now see the imported dataset in the `datasets` table. Well done!
