import VideoPlayer from '../../src/components/VideoPlayer';

When you run an experiment, you probably also want to generate output files - or _artifacts_.
Currently, csquare supports two distinct types of artifacts.

1. Default csquare artifacts.
2. Generic artifacts, which includes log files, and all the other files types.
3. Model checkpoints artifacts which their associated metadata manifests.

In this page, you will learn how to integrate your models artifacts into the csquare platform.

## Default artifacts

csquare currently generates two default artifacts:

### Experiment manifest

The experiment `manifest.json` contains information about the experiment itself.

:::warning
Until the end of the beta program, manifests schema is subject to change at anytime.
:::

```json title=manifest.json

    "datasetsMountPoints": [],

  }
}
```

### Experiment log

The experiment `job.log` is also available as a default artifact.

## Generic artifacts

In order to save your generated artifacts, you need to save the `/artifacts` directory.
Any existing file in this directory will be uploaded to csquare storage infrastructure, so you can download them later.

```tree title="Container filesystem"
/
├── artifacts
│   ├── result.txt
│   └── output.tar
└── code
    └── your code files...
```

:::tip
In a future version of csquare, you will be able to change the default location if the artifact directory
:::

## Checkpoints artifacts

Checkpoint artifacts are specialized artifacts which represent the current state of your model training.
csquare has a dedicated support of the checkpoints.
Checkpoints files must be written in the dedicated folder `/artifacts/checkpoints` and should come with its checkpoint manifest.

### Checkpoint filesystem

The checkpoint manifest allows you to enrich your checkpoint metadata.
Suppose your model is generating the following artifacts, one per epoch:

```raw title="Checkpoints file system"
/artifacts
└── checkpoints
    ├── checkpoint-0.pth.tar
    ├── checkpoint-1.pth.tar
    └── checkpoint-2.pth.tar
```

### Checkpoint manifests

You can register your checkpoint metrics to csquare by providing a checkpoint manifest alongside each checkpoint file.
Checkpoints manifests must be named according to the following convention: `[name].metadata.json`.

```raw title="Checkpoints file system with checkpoints"
/artifacts
└── checkpoints
    ├── checkpoint-0.pth.tar
    ├── checkpoint-0.pth.tar.metadata.json
    ├── checkpoint-1.pth.tar
    ├── checkpoint-1.pth.tar.metadata.json
    ├── checkpoint-2.pth.tar
    └── checkpoint-2.pth.tar.metadata.json
```

Your checkpoint manifests must follow the following format:

```json title=checkpoint-0.pth.tar.metadata.json
{
  "epoch": 0,
  "timestamp": 1623499262.7141566,
  "stats": {
    "loss": 0.20176157355308533,
    "accuracy": 0.9399999976158142
  }
}
```

:::note
Currently, all the manifest fields are mandatory.
:::

### Download checkpoints

Experiments checkpoints can be downloaded after the registration on csquare.

#### Quick guide

<VideoPlayer src="https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.csquare.run/docs/webm/downlad-checkpoints.webm" />

#### Step-by-step

1. [Go to the experiment page](go-to-the-experiment-page).
2. Click on the `Download` button of the `Generated checkpoints` widget.
3. The checkpoints will be downloaded on your computer.
