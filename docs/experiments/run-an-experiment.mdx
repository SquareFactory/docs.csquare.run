Running experiments is the core future of csquare.
Experiments allow you to train deep-learning models while taking full advantage of the dedicated and specialized csquare hardware.

:::note
In order to run an experiment, you need to have created its [parent model](../models/create-a-model).

## Create a new experiment

### Quick guide

### Step-by-step

1. #### [Select the project](../projects/select-a-project.mdx) you want your experiment to be a part of.
2. #### Go to the `Models` page using the sidebar.
3. #### Select to the model you want your experiment to be a part of by clicking on its ID.
4. #### Click on the `+` button: `Create an experiment` of the `Experiments` widget.
5. #### Fill the form
6. Fill the `Commit to clone` field if you want to run your code from a specific commit. If left empty, the latest commit of the branch will be used.
7. Set the `Billing` options as desired, by indicating the number of nodes to use and the experiment's priority. See more info about billing on the [dedicated documentation](../datasets/resources/billing).
8. #### Click on the `Submit` button.

A loader will appear: it means that your new experiment started running!

**Experiments are automatically run at their creation** (see how to [create an experiment](#create-a-new-experiment)). You can however **re-run** an experiment whenever you want.

:::success Tips
You can check an experiment's status in its [dedicated page](go-to-the-experiment-page) or in its parent [model](../models/introduction)'s page.

## Re-run an experiment

You can also use a previous experiment a template istead of creating a new one from scratch.

### Step-by-step

1. [Go to the experiment page](go-to-the-experiment-page).
2. Fill the form:
