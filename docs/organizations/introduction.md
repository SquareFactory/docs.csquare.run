## Definition

**Organizations** are groups of people that can share [projects](../projects/introduction) and data. Access permissions are managed by organization admins.

## Permissions

Organization access are controlled using **permissions**, that can be managed via the `Organization` page. There are
3 levels of permissions, that are summarized in the following table:

|Permission|Possible actions|
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Read |<ul><li>Navigate through the whole organization data that has been shared with you: projects, datasets, models, labs</li> <li>See the project's collaborators</li></ul>|
|Write|<ul><li>Read access</li><li>Create, delete, and modify projects, datasets, labs and models you have access to, if you have at least writing permissions in the project</li></ul>|
|Admin|<ul><li>Read + write access</li><li>Manage organization permissions</li></ul>
