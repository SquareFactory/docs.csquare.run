## Definition

**Organizations** are groups of people that can share [projects](../projects/introduction) and data.
Organization _members_ are counted in seats.

## Permissions

Organization access are controlled using **permissions**, that can be managed via the `Organization` page. There are 3
levels of permissions, that are summarized in the following table:

| Permission | Possible actions                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Member     | <ul><li>Navigate through the whole organization data that has been shared with you: projects, datasets and models</li> <li>See the project's collaborators</li></ul> |
| Admin      | <ul><li>Read + write access</li><li>Manage organization permissions</li></ul>                                                                                        |

## Seats

The csquare platform uses a per-user billing model.
Any user in any project counts as a user seat ; of course, the same user in multiple projects counts a single seat.

Please refer to the pricing table for more information.
