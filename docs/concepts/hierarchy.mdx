The csquare platform has several entity types that can be confusing at first.
Fortunately, they have been specifically designed to give you the best experience from a collaborative and technical standpoint.

On this page, you will learn to distinguish the different entities of csquare and their roles.

The current entity hierarchy is the following:

```
organizations
├── billing account
├── owners and members
└── projects
    ├── datasets
    └── models
        └── experiments
            └── artifacts
```
