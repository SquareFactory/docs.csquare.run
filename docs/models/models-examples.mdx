csquare is a _container-based_ platform, which means that all the experiments you may run on csquare are running inside a container.
Containers are a way to quickly sandbox and get all the tools and software in order to run your model.

## Train a MNIST-based Pytorch Model

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 handwritten digits. It was originally provided by Yann LeCun on his [personal website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist).
See a sample below:
