## Step-by-step
1. [Select the project](../../projects/select-a-project.mdx) you want your experiment to be a part of.
2. Go to the `Models` page using the sidebar.
3. Select to the model you want your experiment to be a part of by clicking on its ID. You will be redirected to its dedicated page.
4. Click on the `+` button: `Create an experiment` of the `Experiments` widget.
5. Fill the form:
    1. Fill the `Commit to clone` field if you want to run your code from a specific commit. If left empty, the latest commit of the branch will be used.
    2. Set the `Billing` options as desired, by indicating the number of nodes to use and the experiment's priority. See more info about billing on the [dedicated documentation](../../datasets/resources/billing).
6. Click on the `Submit` button. A loader will appear: it means that your new experiment started running! You can check its status by returning to the corresponding model page.
