**Experiments are automatically run at their creation** (see how to [create an experiment](create-an-experiment)). You can however **re-run** an experiment whenever you want.

## Step-by-step
1. [Go to the experiment page](go-to-the-experiment-page).
2. Fill the form:
 1. Fill the `Commit to clone` field if you want to run your code from a specific commit. If left empty, the latest commit of the branch will be used.
 2. Set the `Billing` options as desired, by indicating the number of nodes to use and the experiment's priority. See more info about billing on the [dedicated documentation](../../datasets/resources/billing).
3. Click on the `Submit` button. A loader will appear: it means that your new experiment started running! You can check its status by returning to the corresponding model page.
