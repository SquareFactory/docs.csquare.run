Containers are **pulled** (e.g., downloaded) from containers registries. The most famous one is probably the [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).

## Setup a private registry

You can setup any Docker-compatible registry on csquare using the registry credentials.

:::caution

Registries are user-based, which means that all the collaborators that run experiments that require access to your private registry need to set up the credentials accordingly.

:::

<VideoPlayer src="https://cdn.csquare.run/docs/webm/registry-setup.webm" />

### Step-by-step

1. Login to your csquare account.
2. Go to the [settings page](https://csquare.run/settings).
3. Scroll down to "Manage your registries" section.
4. Fill your `host`, `user` and `password`.
5. Hit the `Save` button.

## DockerHub

[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) is the default Docker registry; this is a general-purpose registry where you can find variety of container images from `node` to `php` and also minimal distribution images such as `ubuntu:20.04`.

:::info

Even if you are only using public images from the DockerHub, we highly recommend you to setup your DockerHub credentials on csquare to avoid being rate-limited.
See [DockerHub announcement on rate limit](https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits) for more information.

### Step-by-step

0. Login/register to the DockerHub.
1. Go the [Account Security](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security) page.
2. Create a `New Access Token` and store it carefully.
3. Setup your registry using the following values.

| URL              | User              | Password              |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| `auth.docker.io` | `[your-username]` | `[your-access-token]` |

## NVIDIA NGC

The [NVIDIA NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com) is the home of the official NVIDIA containers. You will find the latest and best images to run your GPU-based experiments.
You can learn more about the NGC on the [introduction page](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/collections/nvidia:gettingstarted).

You can also browse the available containers on the [dedicated container page](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers).

Since the NGC is _not public_ - which means that you have to provide an API key to csquare - you first need to register on the NGC.

1. Sign up here: [https://ngc.nvidia.com/signin](https://ngc.nvidia.com/signin) and confirm your email, accept the terms, etc.
2. [Create an API key](https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key) - copy the key and store it carefully.
3. Setup the **TWO** following registries on csquare:

| URL                | User          | Password         |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| `nvcr.io`          | `$oauthtoken` | `[your-api-key]` |
| `authn.nvidia.com` | `$oauthtoken` | `[your-api-key]` |

:::note

As mentioned in the [NGC instruction page](https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key), the user is **literally** `$oauthtoken`.
