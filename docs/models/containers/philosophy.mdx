## What is a container?

Containers are used at the core of csquare. They allow you to bring your own software stack into the platform to run your experiments.
csquare currently uses Docker-compatible containers.

While containers are traditionally used to deploy small workloads on a server, we use the containers to create a secure, customizable sandbox to run your experiments.
Depending on your compute resources requirements, your container might be the only one to be executed on a compute node.

On the csquare platform, containers are used to help you tu run your workloads with all the tools you need. You might want to use a specific version of Pytorch, or even a specific Linux distribution.
If your model requires GPU support, we recommend you to use official NVIDIA images that you can find on the [NVIDIA NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers).

## Use-cases

### Train a generic Pytorch model

Suppose that you want to train a model to recognize cars and this is based on Pytorch.
You might have a Git repository with the following structure:

```
.
├── lib
│   ├── python1.py
│   └── python2.py
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── train.py
```

In this case, to start your training, you will run the following command:

```shell title="Training startup command"
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py [--epoch=XX --other-args]
```

This model uses GPUs acceleration; you need a Docker image that is made for GPUs.

You finally have the following requirements:

- Python with Pytorch
- GPU support

By browsing the [NVIDIA NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers?query=pytorch), you can quickly find an image that fits your needs.
In this example, we will use: [nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.05-py3](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:pytorch) which comes with:

- Python 3
- Pytorch v21.05
- GPU support

:::note
In order to use the NVIDIA NGC, you need to [set up your registries accordingly](./registries#nvidia-ngc).
:::

:::danger
Ensure that you allocate more memory than your container image size, otherwise your experiment might fail with an `OUT_OF_MEMORY` error.
